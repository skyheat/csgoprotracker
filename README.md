# csgoprotracker
Work in progress...

A simple Flask App that utilises the public FaceitAPI to pull data from the Faceit Pro League Hubs which professional CS:GO Players play on. Doing this allows me to collect information about the player and their matches, seeing the result of the match and scores as well as having an option to download the demo/replay to watch.
